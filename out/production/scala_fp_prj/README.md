### Takeaways

- prefer `vals` over `vars`
- all `vals` and `vars` have `types`
- compiler automatically infers types when omitted
- basic types
    - `Boolean`
    - `Int` `Long` `Double`
    - `String`

#### Expressions
- Basic expressions : operator
- `If` in Scala is an expression
- Code block in Scala are expressions
- Expressions vs instructions
    - instructions are executed (think Java), expressions are evaluated (Scala)
    - in Scala we'll this in terms of expressions
    
#### Function _Call by_ 
- value 
  - value is computed before call
  - same value used everywhere 
- name
  - expression is passed literally
  - expression is evaluated at every use within
  
#### Classes 
- Define classes `class` keyword
- Instantiang `new`
- Parameters vs fields ( using `val` or `var` before nDame parameter)
- Define methods
- Calling methods
